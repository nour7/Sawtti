Audio Fingerprinting in Swift

Developed this prototype app during the Digital Signal Processing course at the university. While this app works in
identifying 15 songs with accuracy of 5-10 seconds, the technique used is not near excellent in selecting peaks and
the hashing algorithm. App can help anyone who wants to practice DSP on iOS using Accelerate framework.

To find out how the audio fingerprinting works, check out the project ![presentation](sawtti_presentation.pdf)

The code should be improved but maybe in future :)
